# Curly_Compiler

Curly is an a programming language built on Plait- a subset of Racket. The following codes demonstrates a compiled version of Curly with key language tools like parser, compiler, interpreter and garbage collector. I developed Curly as part of my project work for CS6520 Programming Languages course undertaken at the University of Utah Fall 2018.
